# Privacy Policy for InstaVolume

Last updated: February 20, 2026

**InstaVolume** ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Chrome extension collects, uses, and discloses information, and what rights you have with respect to that information.

## 1. Information Collection and Use

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

The InstaVolume extension operates entirely locally on your device. It does not track your browsing history, collect usage analytics, or send any data to external servers.

## 2. Permissions

To function correctly, InstaVolume requires the following permissions:

- **Storage (`storage`):** Used solely to save your preferred volume level and mute status locally on your device. This ensures your settings are preserved between sessions.
- **Host Permission (`https://www.instagram.com/*`):** Required to inject the volume control interface into Instagram pages. The extension accesses the page content only to detect video elements and insert the volume slider. It does not read or store any other content from the page.

## 3. Data Safety

- **No Remote Servers:** All operations are performed locally within your browser.
- **No Third-Party Sharing:** Since we do not collect any data, we do not share any data with third parties.
- **No Ads or Tracking:** The extension contains no advertisements or tracking scripts.

## 4. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
